<h2>Programs</h2>

<p>
A <b>darknet</b> is a private network where connections are made only between trusted peers — sometimes called "friends" (F2F) — using non-standard protocols and ports. The collection of all darknets forms a subsection of the Deep Web. Darknets are distinct from other distributed peer-to-peer networks as sharing is anonymous (that is, IP addresses are not publicly shared). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(overlay_network)">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>RetroShare</b> is free software for encrypted filesharing, serverless email, instant messaging, chatrooms, and BBS, based on a friend-to-friend network built on GPG (GNU Privacy Guard). It is not strictly a darknet since optionally, peers may communicate certificates and IP addresses from and to their friends. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RetroShare">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Freenet</b> is a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant communication. It uses a decentralized distributed data store to keep and deliver information, and has a suite of free software for publishing and communicating on the Web without fear of censorship. Both Freenet and some of its associated tools were originally designed by Ian Clarke, who defined Freenet's goal as providing freedom of speech on the Internet with strong anonymity protection. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet">Wikipedia</a>

<p>
Perhaps the Lightning Network is the most anticipated technological novelty for Bitcoin. It is assumed that this payment system, the idea of which was put forward a year ago, will make it possible to carry out a huge number of transactions almost free of charge outside the bitcoyne blockade, and for this one will not have to sacrifice security.
