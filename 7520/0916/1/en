<p>
It is difficult to find someone who would not attach importance to money. They beckon to him, forced to worship, they are in fact the main purpose of life for many people. It turns out, we do not earn in order to live, live to earn. Sami people have erected money on the podium and gave them such properties, killing the faith in the talent and ability by passing all possible potential is money.
