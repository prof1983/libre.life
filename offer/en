The Basic income is divided among all citizens and is the minimum social security guarantee for life. In my model, all taxes (including social tax) are divided into five levels: 1) district, 2) regional, 3) county, 4) country, 5) world. In the case of Basic income (5%): 1% is divided between all residents of the district, 1% is divided among all residents of the region, 1% between all residents of the district, etc.
