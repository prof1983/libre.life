Very few people even from the financial sector to understand where the money come from, what they are, why they are needed, unlike what the words "money" and "currency". For these people, the financial sector - it's only business. But it's not for me. In my opinion the finance - it is a very powerful tool for people management, development management.

<p>
LibreMoney created as a system for raising funds for the "start-ups" in the early stages. This is called crowdfunding. Result crowdfunding usual - this is not some tangible benefits on the similarity of the poster with the personal signature of the author, etc. It's fun, but for many far more important to invest in order to obtain monetary gain in the future. This is called equity crowdfunding. LibreMoney system is designed for this. People can invest (Lm) in the Crowd project for a stake in the project.

<p>
Description of the system work most clearly turns to explain with an example. Assume that the system has a number of participants and there is community. One of the participants of the project proposes to implement CrowdFunding. Project LibreMoney necessarily implemented within the framework of a community. In this project the author must be a member of the community within which plans to hold a fundraiser.

<p>
If the issue of money for any work (as a useful and not useful), the value of "money" will decrease. Therefore LibreMoney new money is issued only after the evaluation of the project's author.

This article introduces a new implementation of the Protocol evidence proportion in which the confirmation of transactions in seconds, providing greater security for a shorter period of time than any existing systems operating under the protocol proofs share PoS. By the time the system Bitcoin will be made only one block, your transaction will be certified for 20% of the shareholders, and by then, Bitcoin to approve the deal and make it almost irreversible (6 blocks, 1 hour), your transaction under DPOS protocol has to be certified 100% of the shareholders through their delegates.
