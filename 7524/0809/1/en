<p>
Re-reading the books of the Peruvian de Soto, I caught myself thinking that they are a wonderful introduction to the libertarian program. Usually de Soto is perceived only as a person who showed the role of the shadow economy in our life. This, it seems to me, is a rather narrow idea. The material that de Soto gives in his books has a much more serious application.
