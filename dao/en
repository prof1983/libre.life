<p>
If you ask the average enthusiast Blokcheyn cryptocurrency or what one key advantage of the technology, there is a high probability that they will give you one specific predictable response: it does not require trust.

<p><a href="/7524/0501/2/en">Visions, Part 1: The Value of Blockchain Technology</a></p>
<p>
One of the questions that has perhaps been central to my own research in blockchain technology is: ultimately, what is it even useful for? Why do we need blockchains for anything, what kinds of services should be run on blockchain-like architectures, and why specifically should services be run on blockchains instead of just living on plain old servers? Exactly how much value do blockchains provide: are they absolutely essential, or are they just nice to have? And, perhaps most importantly of all, what is the “killer app” going to be?

A new model for building successful and massively scalable applications is emerging. Bitcoin led the way with its open-source, peer-to-peer nature, cryptographically-stored records (block chain), and limited number of tokens that power the use of its features.

Sometimes a good idea to require a lot of resources and collective efforts. You can ask for donations. But donors want to be sure that the whole project will receive adequate funding and startanet. In this case, crowdfunding is ideal: you declare a final amount which is necessary for the project and dates during which you plan to collect.

Smart contracts are a form of computer protocols / programs / solutions that are able to provide a fully automated control and execution of the agreements, used in smart contract. The main value of the contracts is smart in that they can reduce the transaction costs of the performance of obligations under the contract and contribute to a relationship of trust between the parties to a contract by virtue of self-sufficiency smart contract for the execution of its terms without the third party.

In certain corners of the crypto community, ‘Decentralized Autonomous Companies’ (DACs), or ‘Distributed Autonomous Organisations’ (DAOs) are all the rage. In the same way that Bitcoin is decentralizing money, DACs seem to offer the potential to decentralize the entire world of business, commerce, finance, and the economy.
