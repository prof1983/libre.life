<h2>FAQ about domain coinfest.ru</h2>

<!--p>
I got rid of the link -- https://vk.com/bitnation?w=wall-88778578_10 (<a href="igor">copy</a>)
<br/>
I do not like that Igor publicly mention my Name and Family. In this case, the fact that he writes - not true. What should I do?
</p>

<p>
<b>
We kicked Igor, don't worry
<br/>
He tried to make you look like a KGB agent
</b>
</p>

<p>
Igor expel not worth it. He just does not understand what is going on in the world. I think he'll understand everything. In the meantime, it is necessary to deal with implementation of decentralized technologies and the creation of a supranational system. Igor in this can help. But give him the representative's authority in Russia is impossible.
</p>

<p>
"He tried to make you look like a KGB agent" --- )))) I did not take the FSB. Said that at first it is necessary to serve in the army. And since I did not serve - and then the FSB will not take me. )))))

<b>
Did you buy coinfest.ru ?
</b>
</p>

<p>
"Did you buy coinfest.ru" -- Yes. 20.01 domain coinfest.ru if Free and I asked my friend Andrey to register domains coinfest.ru and coinfest.su <!-- https://www.facebook.com/andrey.kuznetsoft - Domains registered at him -->
</p>

<p>
<b>Can you explain why you bought it?</b>
</p>

<p>
"Can you explain why you bought it?" --- Because I spent CoinFest-2015-Moscow. I did it because I need followers. All materials are available on the site. Including Video http://coinfest.ru/video/ --- By the way, thanks CoinFest-2015-Moscow I had a lot of friends who understand what is going on in the world, crypto technologies, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Can you give a public statement about that? We usually don't do things secretly. Also Andrew needs to know about the Coinfest organizers.</b>
