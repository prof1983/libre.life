<p>
The original means of combating rural lack of money brought in their Farm entrepreneur from Karmaskalinsky area Artur Nurgaliyev. His farm walk like Russian rubles, and especially the local "currency" - trade coupons that locals have nicknamed "shaymuratikami" - the name of the enterprise "Shaymuratovo". People are happy to take them instead of part of the salary, they take sellers a few stores and they say, even the taxi drivers.
