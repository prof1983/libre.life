<p>
LibreMoney created as a system for raising funds for the "start-ups" in the early stages. This is called crowdfunding. Result crowdfunding usual - this is not some tangible benefits on the similarity of the poster with the personal signature of the author, etc. It's fun, but for many far more important to invest in order to obtain monetary gain in the future. This is called equity crowdfunding. LibreMoney system is designed for this. People can invest (Lm) in the Crowd project for a stake in the project.
