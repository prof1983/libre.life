<p>
Bitcoin - the first and most popular today cryptocurrency that works under this scheme. The protocol was originally Bitcoin can create "smart contracts." Or else, "self-fulfilling contracts". All this is well worked out, but still enjoys limited popularity. Many people do not know that it exists.
</p>

<p>
We need to look further. Namely, on the process of issuing new money, the process of generating blocks, the expansion of the protocol, etc.. Bitcoin — this is the first kriptovalyuta, but it has drawbacks. In particular 51%. And most importantly — an empty useless burning miners, electricity. People understand it and, therefore, offers crypto-currency of the second generation. Such as NXT (NextCoin), etc. 100% PoS.
</p>

<p>
I propose to look further and suggest crypto-currency 100% PoS + emission based on the real work of the people, not for the creation of wealth. This project LibreMoney.org different from all existing currency and crypto-currency. In today’s world money is not secured. So, in fact, to make reliable long-term savings to the liquidity of a currency is not yet possible. I propose to create such a tool. But the main objective of the project LibreMoney not to create money, and to establish a decentralized system of crowd-investing to attract investment for technology start-ups at an early stage (at the idea stage and the prototype stage).
