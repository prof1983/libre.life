<h1>What is money</h1>

<p class="h">
<b>Money is not the value. Money - it's just a reflection of the numerical values.</b>
</p>




<h2>What is the value of</h2>

<p>
Usually, the values ​​is the following. Values ​​- is: 
<br/>
1) products (eg bread, real estate) 
<br/>
2) services (eg haircut etc).
</p>

<p>
Either way goods and services are material. But there are items such as movies, music, OpenSource software technology. All of this - not the material available values.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Value</b> - the importance, relevance, utility and usefulness of something. 
<br/>
<b>Value</b> - as a characteristic of the object, indicating the recognition of its importance. Share "Tangible assets" and "spiritual values."
<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>




<h2>How are values</h2>

<p>
Let us consider an example. Suppose we make clay pots. We have a piece of clay and $ 10 for the manufacture of pot we spend an hour of your time. Suppose an hour costs $ 50. The amount of costs is $ 60. But ready to pot we sell at the market price (assuming it's $ 100). Have an income of $ 100, the cost is $ 60, you get $ 40 profit. It's simple.
</p>

<p>
But let's think. And where did this $ 40? You answer, it's obvious. $ 40 - it is the surplus value. But what is the physical meaning of these $ 40? Hour of labor ($ 50) - a service that clay ($ 10) - that product. A $ 40 - it is neither goods nor services. These $ 40 - surplus value!
</p>

<p>
In other words, we do not just do the pots, and bring value to the world. Its value is called "surplus value."
</p>




<h2>As there is money</h2>

<p>
Now let's look at how to get some money. And here you say that everything is obvious. Money produces the state represented by the Central Bank. New neneg, in theory, produced as much as there is new products and services on the territory of that State. If new money is issued more than appears new products and services, then there is inflation. In this case, Keinsian theory as very good as it is possible to produce more money. This allows you to "develop the economy." Although, in fact, this is called "inflation of bubbles." But we are not talking about that.
</p>

<p>
And so. Money produces a state under the provision of goods and services that are produced in the area (or jurisdiction) of the State. It is legal tender in the territory of that State. Such money is called the national currencies or fiat money.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Fiat money</b> (from Lat. fiat - decree instructed, "so be it") - money, legal tender, the face value of which is established, provided and guaranteed by the state through its authority and power.
<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D4%E8%E0%F2%ED%FB%E5_%E4%E5%ED%FC%E3%E8" target="_blank">ru</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
With this, everything is clear. Goods are in the territory of a particular state and the services provided in the territory of a particular state. And for these goods and services the government issue new money. And what about the free values​​, which are distributed freely on the Internet? Which state does not belong to the material values​​?
</p>




<h2>No material available values</h2>

<p>
De facto, once the film or music falls into the network, it is already no longer belong to anyone. Yes, the legal right to belong to someone. But we're talking about how really going on. Movies, music, technology, and all other digital "goods" which have been published at least once in the network - the de facto belong to the world.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the development of digital "goods" - a piece valuable. Technology and algorithms, sometimes, are very valuable. The question arises. What state, thus, should make the issue of new money? Yes, it is obvious that if the company and its employees are on site and within the jurisdiction of a particular state, that state and will produce emissions. Everything is simple. But if the company is registered in one state, the developers are physically located in another state, and work is being done on servers located in a third State. And if the team is distributed, the work is done in a decentralized manner and without the formation of a legal entity (OpenSource development)? What then? Where it produced values ​​and what state releases new "security" money? All states at once? Or development is not valuable? For example the Linux kernel and other OpenSource projects are valuable development or not? :)
</p>




<h2>Issue of money for no tangible value free</h2>

<p>
We claim that for all material not available emission values ​​should receive their creator. By free we mean here the values ​​of all the values ​​created by free people in a free space of the Internet.
</p>




<h2>Free currency</h2>

<p>
After analyzing all this, we came to the conclusion that the Internet need a free currency (crypto-currency). Especially as the technology to create such a currency already exist and have been used successfully by many people. This Bitcoin and its many forks. But Bitcoin is not money in our understanding. Because Bitcoin issue would not be at useful labor, and distributed randomly for the selection of the hash. In fact the whole system of Bitcoin and its analogues in vain burn electricity without producing useful (scientific) calculations. Therefore, we say that Bitcoin - a type of currency future. There are projects kriptovalyut proposing to make the generation of block-based utility computing. That is correct, but the crypto-currency while at the idea stage.
</p>

<p>
We decided to create the first free crypto-currency, where the issue will receive only the authors of interesting and useful development (movies, music, OpenSource software, inventors, developers of new technologies). Authors will receive as a bonus issue for the useful work, for by value.
</p>




<h2>How to determine the useful work or not and how much</h2>

<figure>
<a href="01b.png"><img src="01.png" /></a>
</figure>

<p>
We offer authors (entrepreneurs), before start developing first conduct a fundraising method of crowd-funding. Thus it is possible before the creation of the need to evaluate the solutions / product.
</p>

<p>
That is the assessment of a particular job will be in two phases. 
<br/>
1. Prior to the establishment, with the help of crowd-founding, determine need the product or not, and how much is needed (what the collected amount of funding). If the required amount of money collected for the project, the more money is automatically transmitted to the author of the project and the work begins.
<br/>
2. After the implementation, by voting, to determine how well the project is implemented. If the project is done well, the author will automatically receive as a bonus issue. If the project is executed poorly, the author of the issue does not get and lost their reputation.
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>
Description of the idea turns out to explain the most clear example. Assume that the system has a few participants and have community. One participant proposes to implement CrowdFunding project. To protect the system, the project is necessarily realized in the framework of a community. The author of the project must be a member of the community within which plans to hold a fundraiser.
</p>

<p>
Communities in the system are needed in order to be able to expert evaluation of the project in the calculation of emissions. Community members in the assessment, act as experts. However, other participants evaluate the experts themselves. Therefore, experts are beneficial to objectively assess projects and avoid in your circle of random people.
</p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>
Let us consider an example of the issue in the system. Suppose that there is an author who offers to collect distribution Linux. Author previously had worked well, there is a community, there are willing to help as advice and money. But need funding. Therefore, the author decides to raise the necessary funds by the method of crowd-funding. And so, what you need to do:
</p>

<p>
1. Register. Register in the system, make a purse.
<br/>
2. Community. If a suitable community yet, it is necessary to create a community. Or to apply for membership in the existing community and wait for approval from the experts (from the community).
<br/>
3. Project. Create a project "build distribution Linux», enter the appropriate amount set deadlines for fundraising and project schedules.
<br/>
4. Fundraising. After the registration of the project, everyone can finance the project (to become depositors).
<br/>
5. Day closure fundraising. If the project does not receive the required amount, the funds collected are automatically returned.
<br/>
6. Implementation of the project. After collecting the funds by getting money at their disposal.
</p>

<a href="04b.png"><img src="04.png" /></a>
</figure>

<p>
7. Hour X end of the project (DeadLine). After the appointed time, when the project should be ready, an assessment. Within a few days passes vote. In this case, estimate the project as investors and experts (community members).
</p>

<figure>
<a href="05b.png"><img src="05.png" /></a>
</figure>

<p>
8. According to the results of voting is determined emission factor is calculated emission, as well as added to or reduced rate reputation.
</p>

<figure>
<a href="06b.png"><img src="06.png" /></a>
</figure>

<p>
Emission depends on several coefficients and the collected amount. In particular interest to the community, the results of the vote of depositors and the results of voting experts.
</p>




<h2>Reputation</h2>

<p>
The system has a numerical display power, which shows how much hard and well served by past projects. Reputation can not be bought, it can only be earned. Reputation is an analogue indicator Karma on HabraHabr.ru.
</p>




<h2>Providing money</h2>

<p>
Since the issue of the system is only for the actual work, for by values ​​- then we would argue that all the money in the system to provide real useful work. Thus we obtain the first provided by the crypto-currency.
</p>




<h2>Protection against the creation of "empty" money</h2>

<p>
The totality of the reputation of each author, and reputation (by weight) of each community within the system will provide protection against the creation of "empty" money. All transactions and all projects are open. As soon as there is any suspicion of fraud - that users of the system "minus" as the author, and the community in which he is a member. By the way, this is why experts (community members) will exhibit an adequate assessment without overstating them.
</p>




<h2>Crowd-venture investing</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>Crowd-investing</b> - an integral part of crowd-funding. The main feature of crowd-investing - the possibility of obtaining compensation for sponsorship, if the project is successful (similar investments).
<br/>

</blockquote>

<p>
The system provides the opportunity to invest in potentially profitable startups - venture capital investment in the early stages. Author of the project organized by the company to raise funds with a view to starting the project with further raising funds from the investment fund. In this case, the fund "buys" shares from the original investors. This is an opportunity for authors to collect seed investment and test your business idea. And a good opportunity for angel investors earn. And most importantly the opportunity to invest in any projects without reference to the site. Of course there are risks. Indicator reputation, partly will be guaranteed.
</p>


<h2>Technical realization</h2>

<p>
Crypto-currency based on PoW not fit, you need a 100% PoS. For a basis we took the source code of the crypto-currency NXT (NextCoin). The source code is completely rewritten for JavaScript (Node.js) and added an emission mechanism.
</p>

<p>
NXT - it's 100% PoS crypto-currency of the second generation.
