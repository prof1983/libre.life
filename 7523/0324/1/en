<h1>Economics, logistics, Finance, money, society, noosphere</h1>

<p>
In this article I present a definition of terms, the knowledge of which is necessary for understanding the System.
</p>


<h2>Economy</h2>

<p>
An <b>economy</b> (Greek οίκος-household and νέμoμαι - manage) or economic system consists of the production, distribution or trade, and consumption of limited goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. The economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">Wikipedia</a>

<p>
<b>Resource-based economy</b> - is a system in which all things and services are available without the use of any commodity-money exchange (money, barter, etc.). A resource-based economy (proposed by the futurist Jacque fresco) is possible only if all natural resources will be declared the common heritage of all people. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BE-%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%8D%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venus_Project">The Venus Project</a>

<p>
<b>Innovation economics</b> is a growing economic theory that emphasizes entrepreneurship and innovation. Innovation economics is based on two fundamental tenets: that the central goal of economic policy should be to spur higher productivity through greater innovation, and that markets relying on input resources and price signals alone will not always be as effective in spurring higher productivity, and thereby economic growth. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation_economics">Wikipedia</a>

<p>
<b>Information economy</b> is an economy with an increased emphasis on informational activities and information industry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economy">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
The <b>knowledge economy</b> is the use of knowledge (savoir, savoir-faire, savoir-etre) to generate tangible and intangible values. Technology and in particular knowledge technology help to transform a part of human knowledge to machines. This knowledge can be used by decision support systems in various fields and generate economic values. Knowledge economy is also possible without technology. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy">Wikipedia</a>
</p>



<h2>Logistics</h2>

<a href="05.jpg"><img src="05-1024.jpg"/></a>

<p>
<b>Logistics</b> — organization of a rational process of promotion of goods and services from suppliers of raw materials to consumers, the functioning of the circulation of products, goods, services, inventory management and provisions, infrastructure merchandising, planning, management and control of the movement of material, informational and financial resources in different systems.

<h2>Finance</h2>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>
<b>Finance</b> is a field that deals with the allocation of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of certainty and uncertainty. Finance also applies and uses the theories of economics at some level. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. A key point in finance is the time value of money, which states that purchasing power of one unit of currency can vary over time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance">Wikipedia</a>
</p>




<h2>Society</h2>

<figure>
<img src="08.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>
An <b>information society</b> is a society where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The aim of the information society is to gain competitive advantage internationally, through using information technology (IT) in a creative and productive way. The knowledge economy is its economic counterpart, whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Network society</b> is the expression coined in 1981 related to the social, political, economic and cultural changes caused by the spread of networked, digital information and communications technologies. The intellectual origins of the idea can be traced back to the work of early social theorists such as Georg Simmel who analyzed the effect of modernization and industrial capitalism on complex patterns of affiliation, organization, production and experience. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_society">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
The term <b>information revolution</b> (sometimes called also the "informational revolution") describes current economic, social and technological trends beyond the Industrial Revolution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_revolution">Wikipedia</a>

<p>
<b>Post-industrial society</b> - In sociology, the post-industrial society is the stage of society's development when the service sector generates more wealth than the manufacturing sector of the economy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-industrial_society">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
The <b>Information Age</b> (also known as the Computer Age, Digital Age, or New Media Age) is a period in human history characterized by the shift from traditional industry that the industrial revolution brought through industrialization, to an economy based on information computerization. The onset of the Information Age is associated with the Digital Revolution, just as the Industrial Revolution marked the onset of the Industrial Age. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Information space</b> is the set of concepts and relations among them held by an information system;[1] it describes the range of possible values or meanings an entity can have under the given rules and circumstances. Another definition (idealistic) is that the information space are the total results of the semantic activity of the humanity, "the world of names and titles", conjugated to the ontological world. Being a primary concept, the information space cannot be precisely defined and is set as a dialectical opposition to the material, physical, object space. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_space">Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
The <b>noosphere</b> (/ˈnoʊ.əsfɪər/; sometimes noösphere) is the sphere of human thought. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">Wikipedia</a> Noosphere (from the Greek. νόος - mind and σφαῖρα - ball) - the sphere of the mind; the interaction between society and nature, in which a reasonable human activity becomes the determining factor in the development.

<b>Posthuman</b>
<br/>
Close to post-industrial theory are the concepts of information society, post-economic society, postmodern, "the third wave", "the company's fourth", "scientific information stage of the principle of production." Some futurists believe that post-industrialism - it's only the beginning of the transition to a "post-human" phase of development of our civilization. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE#.D0.A1.D1.83.D1.89.D0.BD.D0.BE.D1.81.D1.82.D1.8C_.D0.B8_.D0.BA.D0.BE.D0.BD.D1.86.D0.B5.D0.BF.D1.86.D0.B8.D1.8F_.D1.80.D0.B0.D0.B7.D0.B2.D0.B8.D1.82.D0.B8.D1.8F_.D0.BF.D0.BE.D1.81.D1.82.D0.B8.D0.BD.D0.B4.D1.83.D1.81.D1.82.D1.80.D0.B8.D0.B0.D0.BB.D1.8C.D0.BD.D0.BE.D0.B3.D0.BE_.D0.BE.D0.B1.D1.89.D0.B5.D1.81.D1.82.D0.B2.D0.B0">Wikipedia</a>
