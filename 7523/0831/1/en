<p>
System crowdfunding got the widest distribution, won the people's love and proven effective, making it possible to implement many projects. This petition is proposed to use a scheme similar to crowdfunding as a system of public financing. For every taxpayer in this system will open an account, which will be transferred to its tax payments. Citizens therefore have the opportunity to dispose of their taxes and send them to the implementation of those projects that really meet their needs and interests. Also, citizens will be able to offer the public their own projects, applying for state funding. This scheme is in addition to the other advantages rule out the possibility of abuse by officials at an expenditure of budgetary funds.
