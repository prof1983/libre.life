A few words about the systems we create.
</p>


<h2>About money</h2>

<p>
We are working to create a resource and reputation system. Where the measure of the value (resources) is an internal accounting unit. In fact, we are creating a real modern money. Money does not exist without resources. Money - it is 1) a measure of value, 2) a medium of exchange, and 3) a means of accumulation. We must understand that dollars, rubles and other currencies - not money. While performing the role of money in the short term.
