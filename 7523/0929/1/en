This publication was born from the article <a href="/7522/1121/1/ru">Universe 25</a>. The fact is that in an ideal utopian system, people will die. For the life of essential problems. Either external or imaginary. When Jacque Fresco talks about the abundance and the fact that in the future all people will have any resources of interest to them - it seems to me this is not true. If there is no incentive to reach something that humanity will become extinct.
