Friends! There was the creation of the economic game with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell" target="_blank">demurrage</a> (negative persent, charge for storage of money). Goal of the game - training businessmen effect when the money "melt", show that <a href="/7522/0829/1/en">money is not a value</a> in itself. And the main thing - to show the effect of repeated turnover growth and social benefit. These "games" have not always carried out once the effect is the same: in theory everything looks dull, but in practice, when entrepreneurs make the final calculations - the "wow" effect. And then there is an understanding of why there is growth.
