<p>How do we know a court decision was <strong>just</strong>? Is there an objective way to make <strong>moral judgements</strong>? Whereas I&#8217;m certainly in no position to tell you whether moreality is objectively definable or not, I&#8217;m convinced that the judgement of a <em><strong>mutually agreed upon arbitrator</strong></em> is of higher value for for both conflicting parties than the final verdict of a <strong>monopolistic law provider</strong> AKA <strong>the state</strong>.<span id="more-7214"></span></p>

<p>What is the law? It is supposed to be the result of a society&#8217;s customs and traditions, serving as the neutral <strong>reference point</strong> for those seeking <strong>arbitration</strong> rather than resolving disputes by <strong>brute force</strong>, like barbarians (&#8220;might makes right&#8221;).  Laws have traditionally evolved through majority consensus between <strong>merchants</strong>, the British Common Law was merely the written manifestation of what was <strong>already agreed upon on the marketplace</strong>.</p>

<p>What happened ever since the <strong>rise of the nation state</strong> was the perversion of law: Instead of making the lives of the people easier, governments have used their citizen&#8217;s trust to their code of law as a tool to <strong>enforce their will on everyone</strong>. Those in power and their cronies have done their best to let their citizens believe that <strong>being in power</strong> is enough to legitimize their role as <strong>sole legal authority</strong>, and that it would work out fine if everyone complies and never questions the given guidelines of what is right and wrong.</p>

<p>They set up a complex system of educational <strong>mass indoctrination</strong> and <strong>licencing</strong> for every aspiring lawmaker to go through, to make sure only those supporting the status quo get the jobs.</p>

<p>We have come to the point where jurisprudence defies any form of common sense and rules only in favour of those who pay/pressure them the most, making it<strong> impossible for anyone to change the system from within</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>So, what other way out is left?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I propose we <strong>create a voluntary , non-geographic parallel system</strong>, with <em><strong>competing codes of laws and judges</strong></em>. Free market mechanisms will ensure that the <strong>will of the market participants influences</strong> the law. As long as law customers remain interested in <strong>peace and voluntaryism</strong>, all immoral and corrupt judges will have no good revenue in this market.</p>

<p>
How could such a <strong>stateless law market</strong> be brought about in today&#8217;s statist world? <a title="BITNATION – General" href="http://www.bitnation-blog.com/bitnation-general/" target="_blank"><strong>Bitnation</strong></a> has the answer!

We provide the <strong>tools</strong> for just law production: Our <strong><a title="What are DApps?" href="http://www.bitnation-blog.com/what-are-dapps/" target="_blank">DApps</a></strong> give arbitrators and their customers a <strong>platform for anonymous communication</strong>, a secure payment with <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> and integrated <strong>rating systems</strong>, to make sure the market&#8217;s <strong>reputation mechanism</strong> works. Law enforcement cannot be guaranteed (yet) , but those refusing to comply to the verdict of a mutually agreed upon arbitrator will be <strong>ostracized from our private law market</strong> and will have to return to using monopolistic government law providers.

<p>
Bitnation&#8217;s law DApps will give every customer the possibility to <strong>choose their preferred code of law</strong>, so that conflicts will be managed by arbitrators with an expertise that <strong>suits both conflicting parties sets of beliefs</strong>. Furthermore, the whole procedure will be much more <strong>cost-efficient</strong> than today&#8217;s legal system and <strong>customer-oriented</strong>. Judgements will be <strong>publicly visible on the blockchain</strong>, testified by a global audience of users. It&#8217;s like AirBnB or Uber for arbitration, because <strong>that&#8217;s what law was always supposed to be</strong>: Convenient, peaceful and alleviating everyday life.
