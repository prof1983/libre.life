<h1>Blockchain Predictions 2025</h1>

<p>
I like predictions made by Ray Kurzweil. They are fun and quite accurate. I believe that we are living in a time when a startup should make strategic business decisions based on such predictions. Otherwise, it risks to stay in a business just for a short time and eventually lose in a technology race.
</p>

<p>
Making predictions for <a href="/7519/0921/1/en">cybernomics</a> is risky but I decide to do it as I have something to share with you, on one hand, and, on the other, I want to test my own ability to forecast.
</p>




<h2>Vision 2025</h2>

<p>
We are now in 2015. What I think of the current state of the blockchain economy could be found in Cybernetic Economy Report 2014 and 2015 H1.
</p>

<p>
The next 5 prediction are from those reports. By 2025:
</p>

<ul>
<li>~10B people (or almost all people) will use blockchains or distributed ledgers
<li>~100B robots (or every machine) will use blockchains or distributed ledgers
<li>~10B autonomous entities (AEs) will exist. AE is a new kind of a living form. AEs are decentralized autonomous organization of the decentralized applications that could exist as first class entities in computer networks without obtaining any material form.
<li>An exponential growth of the blockchain economy will lead to the obsolescence of fiat currencies that makes it hard to predict a volume of the cybernomics. But it should reach not less than 1Q in current USD.
<li>Existing legal system will become obsolete.
</ul>

<p>
I am an economist. Exploration of blockchain and decentralized consensus protocols awakes in me a follower of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School" target="_blank">Austrian school</a> of economic thought. Though cybernomics inherent so much austrian it is going far beyond. A good understanding of economic reasoning including a concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations" target="_blank">diffusion of innovations</a> enables me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Wild-Ass_Guess" target="_blank">SWAG</a> based on existing feedback loops and extrapolations.
</p>

<p>
So the following predictions are in fact just an attempt to understand a fundamental transformation of our society that has been happening at high speed. To be honest I think my predictions are a little bit naive as in parallel great technologies are evolving such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas9" target="_blank">CRISPR/Cas9</a> or <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/" target="_blank">Quantum computing</a> consequences of which I am incompetent to evaluate.
</p>




<h2>How will we get there?</h2>

<p>
Taken this for granted a task is not to invent anything but to put inevitable events on a timeline.

<h2>Augur - A Clear Future</h2>

<p>
Ray Kurzweil makes <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/how-my-predictions-are-faring-an-update-by-ray-kurzweil" target="_blank">accuracy analysis of his predictions</a>. The most comprehensive one was made in 2010 concerning predictions from 1999 to 2009.
</p>

<p>
This is not just a blog post. It is an experiment. I will put <b>100 ethers</b> into decentralized prediction marketplace Augur thus allowing to compute my predictions even before they happen with >95% accuracy in 2020, five years earlier than a target time. That has never been done before. Moreover, this would work in favor of my predictions and, perhaps, make forecast <a href="http://lesswrong.com/" target="_blank">less wrong</a>. Once Augur is launched I will update this post putting links to bets. Exciting? Let’s check!
</p>

<br/>

<p>
By the way: Augur’s crowdsale starts on 17th August.
