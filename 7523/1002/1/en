<p>
One of the founders of the consortium "Alpha-Group" Mikhail Fridman sure that in the next few years in the banking sector will take place tremendous changes.
In the next ten years in the banking sector will occur "absolutely enormous changes", and by the end of this period, the banks, to which we are accustomed, will cease to exist, I am sure a member of the Board of Directors of Alfa-Bank, co-owner and head of the supervisory board of "Alpha groups" Mikhail Fridman.
