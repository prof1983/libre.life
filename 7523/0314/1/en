<h1>Latest update 22.12.2014</h1>

<p>
Bitnation started in July 2014 and is a Distributed Organisation (DO) incorporated on the Bitcoin blockchain. During the roughly five months since the start of Bitnation, beyond setting up the organization, creating crypto-equity and launching a crowdsale, Bitnation has accomplished a range of groundbreaking events, not only proving the technology, but also communicating a clear message to the world: you do not need monopolistic nation state governments to enjoy governance services. Read more below under ‘pilots’.
</p>

<p>
In tandem with building the organization, Bitnation has also advanced on the technology side, on multiple platforms (read more under ‘development updates’). However, our greatest achievement is in setting up a worldwide grassroots network of crypto entrepreneurs, our Ambassador Network, specifically in emerging and frontier markets, where Bitnation’s services are needed the most.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to everyone who have followed us along in this great adventure, and cheers to a better, voluntary future, created through peaceful solutions!

<h2>Bitnation Pilots</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Bitmarriage</b> – World’s first blockchain wedding: Bitnation organized the first ever blockchain marriage on October 5th at Disney World, Florida, US at the Coins in The Kingdom conference. The wedding was widely covered by media, including the Wall Street Journal and Russia Today.
</li>

<li>
<b>BitID</b> – World Citizenship Passport on the blockchain: Bitnation organized the first ever pilot for a blockchain based World Citizen Passport in London, based on Chris Ellis World Citizenship Passport protocol, covered by, amongst others; Wired, Forbes, and TechCrunch.
</li>

<li>
<b>Bitland</b> – World’s first blockchain land deed pilot: In November 2014 Bitnation started its Land deed pilot in Ghana, Outside of Kumasi, which will be finalized in January 2015. The lack of land deeds in Ghana is a major source of conflict, and prevents economic growth and mobility.
</li>

<li>
<b>Other upcoming pilots</b>: During Q1 and Q2 2015 Bitnation plan on conducting two more pilots, one for corporate incorporation on the blockchain, and another to create birth certificates on the blockchain.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Development update</h2>

<ul>

<li>Bitnation Pangea: Bitnation Pangea is the base platform which is currently being developed. A first demo will be released in Q1 2015. All other governance Apps and DApps will be hosted on Pangea. API is scheduled to be released in Q1 2015 as well, however all timelines are subject to change.</li>

<li>Bitnation Agora: Bitnation Agora will serve as a platform for corporate incorporation on the Bitnation platform, through creating cryptoequity and timestamping shareholder agreements. An initial demo will be released Q1 2015.</li>

<li>BitID: The BitID is a simplified version of the ID pilot, intended to provide printed ID cards, which will be on sale on the Bitnation website shortly. A verification and reputation system will be developed throughout 2015.</li>

<li>Bitmarriage, and more: During Q1 and Q2 2015 Bitnation will release the first set of family contracts using smart contract technology.</li>

</ul>

<h3>3rd Party Apps and DApps</h3>

<ul>
<li>co: basicincome.co is a 3rd Party DApp designed for the Bitnation platform by inventor Johan Nygren, with the aim of creating a basic income platform based on voluntary participation and taxation. There’s no set release date yet, and Johan is keen to get more developers involved in the project – you can check out the GitHub to contribute and read more about the concept here: <a href="http://basicincome.co/">basicincome.co</a></li>
<li>Two more 3rd party apps are currently in development for the Bitnation platform, more information will be available in Q1 2015</li>
</ul>


<h2>Crowdsale update</h2>

<p>
Timeframes: The crowdsale was intended to start on October 10th, but it got delayed with a few days becuase vennd.io, the company providing the sales module to transfer BTC to XBNX, pulled out on the day of the launch without prior warning, due to fear of Australian regulations. Bitnation had to rebuild the sales module which took a few days, and even after it was rebuilt there were still quite a few transfer issues, beyond the standard CounterWallet bugs. Hence, because of the initial delays, we will postpone the end of the crowdsale until the end of the month, January 31st 2015.
</p>

<p>
The crowdsale is important because we want to avoid relying on a few powerful angel investors controlling the direction of Bitnation. It must remain a free and independent movement.
</p>

<p>
Price: The price is currently 0.05 USD per XBNX (roughly 8000 XBNX per BTC). By the end of the year we will increase it to 0.061 USD per XBNX as we’ll have met 4 of the 6 stated benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Addresses:</b>
</p>

<p>
The address currently linked to the account: 1Q6QnUx83BH4qKwAtm7qbZztxvWTtU7XEk
</p>

<p>
The multisig address where the funds are transferred: 3KS6AuQbZARSvqnaHoHfL1Xhm3bTLFAzoK
</p>

<p>
Recently CounterParty integrated multisig into their wallet, hence the address will change to transfer directly to the multisig in Q1 2015.
</p>

<p>
US Citizens/ Residents: The crowdsale is not open for US citizens or residents due to SEC regulations, however US citizens and residents can support Bitnation through donating to 1Q6QnUx83BH4qKwAtm7qbZztxvWTtU7XEk or through buying Bitnation t-shirts at https://bitnation.myshopify.com/ Every contribution is appreciated!

More tutorials and help material will be published soon, but for now please check out our GitHub entry and contribute if you feel inclined to do so.</li>

<li><b>New Team Members</b>: We’re excited to welcome several new team member including Hafez Mancayo, a long term colleague and friend of the founders. Hafez is based in Bandung, Indonesia, and has been doing an amazing job on the server maintenance and development side. We would also like to welcome Narigamba Mwinsuubo, based in Ghana, Kumasi, who’s a an Anarchist blogger and Bitcoin promoter, and who’ve been instrumental in organizing the land deed pilot, amongst other things. Kasper Mikkel Sonne, from Denmark, Copenhagen have contributed greatly to the process of organizing documentation and team work across the multiple channels and geographical locations. David Bailey, known from HardBTC, is working hard indeed on our ID Card platform, and has contributed with BTC pins which we’ve been spreading at the Bitcoin seminar in Ghana to students. We’re also pleased to have David Orban, from the Network Society Project on board as an advisor, who contributes with meaningful organizational advice as well as Governance 2.0 insights. Additionally we would like to thank Janina Lowisz who was the first person to become a ‘Blockchain World Citizen’ and who’s been helping out with social media, Vikram Nikkam who’ve done an outstanding work organizing the bi-weekly meetups, and Philip Asare in Ghana, who’ve been helpful for Bitnation’s setup in the country, and connecting with other Ambassadors all over Africa. More announcement to come next month!</li>
