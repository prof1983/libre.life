Dear friends!
</p>

<p>
I remind you that tomorrow, Thursday 21 May at 18:00 at the University "RosNOU" at ul. Radio 22, the audience will take 704 "InnoShow". This will be the first official event of our experts, which will soon be transformed into "Expert Council to promote public support innovative projects at the Commission on industry, innovation and the development of science cities of the Public Chamber of the Moscow region". The necessary steps have already been taken (a letter of appeal to the Public Chamber of the Moscow region in the attachment). I was assured that, in connection with the relevance of its initiative procedure review and approval will not take much time.
