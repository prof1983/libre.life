<p>
In accordance with international law, a group of Czech citizens, gathered in a Preparatory Committee, decided to declare a new state, Free Republic of Liberland, in the territory defined by the coordinates below.
</p>

<p>
Its total area of about 7 square kilometres makes Liberland the third smallest sovereign state, after the Vatican and Monaco. Liberland is located along the Danube River between Croatia and the Republic of Serbia. The territory is not claimed by either of these two states. It was a no man’s land – terra nullius – as defined by international conventions.
</p>

<p>
On 13 April 2015 the Preparatory Committee declared the new state on the spot and raised a flag to claim the land. The Committee also elected the President of the Republic, who was also commissioned to send diplomatic notes not only to the two neighbouring states, but also to the United Nations and later to other countries, in order to inform them about the establishment of the new state of Liberland.
</p>

<p>
The objective of the founders of the new state is to build a country where honest people can prosper without being oppressed by governments making their lives unpleasant through the burden of unnecessary restrictions and taxes. One of the reasons for founding Liberland is the ever expanding influence of interest groups on the functioning of existing states and the consequent worsening of living conditions of people. The founders are inspired by countries such as Monaco, Liechtenstein or Hong Kong.
</p>

</p>
Liberland is led by its President Vít Jedlička, who was elected by the Preparatory Committee. Free Republic of Liberland intends to accept applications for citizenship. Further details are available on the official website of the state <a href="http://www.liberland.org/">www.liberland.org</a>.
