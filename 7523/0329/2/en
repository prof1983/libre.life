<h1>About the creation of the State</h1>

<p>
I am preparing the documents to create a virtual state 2.0 - Manifesto Kontitutsiyu, ideologies and organizations. Took as a basis for the project Debian. And as InternationalCenter, Minor Constitution, the UN Convention, as well as various Charter. In particular, the "Charter of the Global Information Society" (July 22 2000) and "Human rights of access to the Internet." I intend to make the announcement at a conference on 2 April. Propose the effective date of the constitution of the Virtual State - 20 March 2016. Up to this point it is necessary to write a constitution, agree in the community and a vote. This is necessary for legal registration of companies (DAC) under the jurisdiction of our state.
