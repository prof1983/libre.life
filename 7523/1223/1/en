First, the text from Facebook, which prompted me to these thoughts:
</p>

<p>
When your child earns his first money for ice cream, do the following:
<br/>
1. Before he has time to lick their ice cream, snatched it from him and bit 20%.
<br/>
2. As long as the child will stare in amazement at you bit off more 30%.
</p>
