<h2>Basic concepts of functioning of the organization</h2>

<ul>
<li>Complete independence and self-government based on the principles of meritocracy (decisions are made by the most talented developers).</li>
<li>Open to all developers who want to take part in the project and agree with the rules established in the community.</li>
<!--li>Привлечение корпоративных разработчиков и финансирование индивидуальных энтузиастов за счет спонсорской помощи заинтересованных в сотрудничестве коммерческих компаний.</li>
<li>Лицензионное соглашение не запрещает создание на основе разработок Ядра коммерческих продуктов.</li-->
</ul>


<h2>Technocracy</h2>

<p>
<b>Technocracy</b> is a form of government in which engineers, scientists, health professionals and other technical experts are in control of decision making in their respective fields.
The term technocracy  derives from the Greek words tekhne meaning skill and kratos  meaning power, as in government, or rule.
Thus the term technocracy denotes a system of government where those who have knowledge, expertise or skills compose the governing body.
In a technocracy decision makers would be selected based upon how highly knowledgeable they are, rather than how much political capital they hold.

<h2>Meritocracy</h2>

<p>
<b>Meritocracy</b> is a system of government or other organization wherein appointments are made and responsibilities assigned to individuals based upon demonstrated intelligence and ability (merit).
Meritocracy itself is not a form of government, but rather an ideology or methodology for the appointment of individuals to government.
Individuals appointed to a meritocracy are judged based upon certain merits which could range from intelligence to morality to general aptitude to specific knowledge.
A criticism of this methodology is that "merit" itself is a highly subjective, vague term potentially lacking clarity allowing for potential misuse.
