<h2>BITNATION IS A COLLABORATIVE PLATFORM FOR DO-IT-YOURSELF GOVERNANCE</h2>

<p>
Bitnation provides the same services traditional governments provide, from dispute resolution and insurance to security and much more – but in a geographically unbound, decentralized, and voluntary way. Bitnation is powered by Bitcoin 2.0 blockchain technology – a cryptograhically secured public ledger distributed amongst all of its users.
</p>

<p>
As we like to say – Bitnation: Blockchains, Not Borders.
</p>


<h2>BORDERLESS</h2>

<p>
BITNATION does not care where in the world you are from, where you live, or what passport you hold. Everyone hast he right to enjoy, high-end, competitive governance services.
</p>


<h2>DECENTRALIZED</h2>

<p>
BITNATION operates on the Blockchain – a cryptographically secured public ledger distributed amongst all of ist millions of users around the world, to ensure peer-to-peer autonomy.
</p>


<h2>VOLUNTARY</h2>

<p>
BITNATION is dedicated to the open source philosophy, and provides a platform for users to develop their own governance functions, or fork the code and create a brand new governance system.
</p>

<p>
BITNATION is incorporated with the same technology cryptocurrencies use – the Blockchain technology. BITNATION also accepts cryptocurrencies for its services, and pays expenses such as salaries and dividends in cryptocurrencies.
</p>

<p>
All code used will be open source code, shared on GiftHub for the community to use, improve, and fork.
</p>

<p>
“During the roughly five months since the start of Bitnation, beyond setting up the organization, creating crypto-equity and launching a crowdsale, Bitnation has accomplished a range of groundbreaking events, not only proving the technology, but also communicating a clear message to the world: you do not need a monopolistic nation state government to enjoy governance services.”
</p>

Money does not exist without resources. Money - it is 1) a measure of value, 2) a medium of exchange, and 3) a means of accumulation. We must understand that dollars, rubles and other currencies - not money. While performing the role of money in the short term. <a href="/7523/0313/1/en">Read more...</a></p>
