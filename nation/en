<p>
In fact, people do not need the state. Until now, the office is $ 2,000, waiting for someone who substantiates the need for the existence of the state. But of the 500 comments under the entry for this award on my page in the VC, no one gave a clear answer to the question, why is it us.

<p>
Estonian authorities believe that the land and the territory - is outdated formality. To be a citizen, you do not have to live in a particular country. Baltic states proves this thesis in practice: the population increases due to the "e-citizens" and creates digital Embassy on remote servers.

<p>
Estonia intends to increase the number of its residents by offering electronic citizenship. The program, which started 2 years ago, allows any citizen of the country to open a bank account and a business and manage it remotely. Thus the government hopes to attract 10 million virtual citizens, mostly - entrepreneurs.

<p>
This publication was born from the article Universe 25. The fact is that in an ideal utopian system, people will die. For the life of essential problems. Either external or imaginary. When Jacque Fresco talks about the abundance and the fact that in the future all people will have any resources of interest to them - it seems to me this is not true. If there is no incentive to reach something that humanity will become extinct.

<p>
How do we know a court decision was just? Is there an objective way to make moral judgements? Whereas I’m certainly in no position to tell you whether moreality is objectively definable or not, I’m convinced that the judgement of a mutually agreed upon arbitrator is of higher value for for both conflicting parties than the final verdict of a monopolistic law provider AKA the state.

<p>We are working to create a resource and reputation system. Where the measure of the value (resources) is an internal accounting unit. In fact, we are creating a real modern money. Money does not exist without resources. Money - it is 1) a measure of value, 2) a medium of exchange, and 3) a means of accumulation. We must understand that dollars, rubles and other currencies - not money. While performing the role of money in the short term.
