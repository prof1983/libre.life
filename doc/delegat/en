<h1>Delegate</h1>

<p>
<b>Delegation</b> is the assignment of responsibility or authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is one of the core concepts of management leadership. However, the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it is a shift of decision-making authority from one organizational level to a lower one. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation">Wikipedia</a>
