<p class="h">
Debian Project Leader
</p>

<p>
The Debian Project Leader (DPL) is the official representative of the Debian Project. They have two main functions, one internal and one external.
</p>

<p>
In the external function, the Project Leader represents the Debian Project to others. This involves giving talks and presentations about Debian and attending trade shows, as well as building good relationships with other organizations and companies.
</p>

<p>
Internally, the Project Leader manages the project and defines its vision. They should talk to other Debian developers, especially to the delegates, to see how they can assist their work. A main task of the Project Leader therefore involves coordination and communication.
</p>


<h2>Appointment</h2>

<p>
The Project Leader is chosen in an election in which all Debian Developers are eligible to vote. The Project Leader's term of office is one year. Nine weeks before the leadership post becomes vacant, the <a href="/doc/info/secretary/en">Project Secretary</a> initiates a new election. During the first three weeks, any Debian Developer can become a candidate for this post by nominating themselves. The next three weeks are used for campaigning. Each candidate posts their platforms and everyone can direct questions to one or all candidates. The last three weeks consist of the polling period during which developers may cast their votes.
</p>

More information about the leader elections are available at the <a href="https://www.debian.org/vote/">voting pages</a>.
