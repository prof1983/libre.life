<h1>Hypothesis of the space structure</h1>

<p>
The monography we offer to our reader describes our hypothesis of the space structure (i.e., the physical vacuum).
</p>

<p>
The existence of several time-spatial levels of a certain discrete periodical structure has been assumed. Any violations of the periodical structure of these levels are interpreted in terms of substance or physical fields.
</p>

<p>
Two time-spatial structures have been considered in detail. Their principal features characterize them as follows.
</p>

<ol>
<li>A two-component structure with the lattice constant amounting ca. 10<sup>-26</sup> cm, the interaction propagation rate being ca. 10<sup>6</sup> -fold light velocity.
<li>A two-component structure with the lattice constant approaching 10<sup>-17</sup> cm, the interaction propagation rate being equal to light velocity.
</ol>

<p>
The basic defects of the structures (vacancies or interstitial objects) are regarded as neutrinos for the structure (1) or as quarks for the structure (2), while elements of the structure (2) represent themselves as certain defect complexes of the structure (1).
</p>

<p>
We have found a correlation between all the known so far elementary particles and certain sets of point defects of the structures (1) and (2). Strong fields correlate with the volume distortions of the structure (2), electromagnetic fields are associated with its shift distortions, while gravity fields are regarded as correlation with the volume distortions of the structure (1). We believe thence that the action of some defects in the structure (1) upon the structure (2) results in the weak interactions.
</p>

<p>
It is supposed further on that both structures are characterized by internal chaotic movement, its effective temperature amounting 2.7 <sup>0</sup>K. This movement results in quantum indeterminations, whereas rotating (or exchange) mechanism dominates in defect migration within both structures. The existence of elementary particle spin is a specific effect of the mechanism.
</p>

<p>
The offered hypothesis can solve at quantity level the most part of the modern physics paradoxes, i.e. the Relativity theory paradoxes, the corpuscular and wave dualism, the quantum divergences and so on.
</p>

<p>
Our hypothesis gives a new approach to a number of cosmogonic problems, including the effect of "the red shifting", "the great explosion", "the Universe heating death", the movement with over light velocities, "the black hole" structure and some others.
</p>

<p>
We hope that our hypothesis would find response from the scientific society and be an impet to new research works in the field.
